### Data Reporting Critiqes###
1. I would give the reporter a 4. The story was really good at raising concern for the hazards that children face at schools that often neglect repairs like new paint. I would've liked to know how common it is for students to be affected by lead poisening though. The headline itself did a great job of communicating the point of the story.
2. I think the data visualization did a good job of presenting the data in an understandable way. I would give it a 5. I would have organized the schools to go together instead of mixing them up a bit.
3. I am no expert on how true the data is. The article did mention that the most accurate way to measure for asbestos is to do air monitoring not dust wiping. I would give this article a 4 because of that. It was the school district that argued this so it would be worth following up with some sort of expert in the matter. They did provide an explanation for who collected the data and what the results mean.
4. I would give the story a 4. As I mentioned before, I would have liked to know how common it is for kids to get hurt from lead poisening from peeling paint or asbestos being present.
5. I think the reporter used appropriate colors and fonts. In the beginning there was black and yellow, which is often associated with toxicity.The font used in the headline was also appropriate as it is the type of font used for warning signs.
6. I would say the photgraphy used in the piece was the most effective component. It was disturbing to see so much mold in an elementary school.

### Short Pitch ###
1. I want to know which voting systems used in different democracies lead to more women being elected to office. 
2. We are able to see which countries are democratic, what voting system they use and how many women are currently in office.
3. The US has just elected its first ever woman vice president. We are slowly progressing towards a future where we may someday have a woman as president. I think it is relevant to see how women fair in elections around the world.
4. I could talk to women who hold a public office position and try to understand how their campaign process was and whether or not they felt their gender had a role to play in how the campaign went down.
5. Heading: "US Democracy Not So Democratic Towards Women"
